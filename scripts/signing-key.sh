# Create and rotate the OpenPGP keys that sign brig's RPM packages and
# repository metadata. Run it on a trusted machine, from a checkout of the
# repo.
#
# Usage: signing-key.sh                 create the first key
#        signing-key.sh --next          add a new key beside the current one
#        signing-key.sh --switch FILE   sign with the secret key in FILE
#        signing-key.sh --retire FPR    stop trusting key FPR
#
# Without options, it
# - generates an RSA-4096 signing key without passphrase or expiry in a
#   throwaway GnuPG home
# - creates the GitHub environment rpm-signing if needed and restricts it to
#   the main branch, so that only workflow runs on main can read its secrets;
#   it removes any other deployment branch or tag policy of that environment
# - stores the secret key as secret RPM_SIGNING_KEY of that environment via
#   the gh CLI
# - writes the public key to packaging/brig-release/RPM-GPG-KEY-brig, to be
#   committed
# - keeps a backup of the secret key and its revocation certificate in
#   ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/brig/signing-key/; move them to offline
#   storage
#
# RPM-GPG-KEY-brig lists every key that clients trust, and publish.sh signs
# with one of them, re-signing the packages it restores that another listed
# key signed. A planned rotation therefore takes three steps, each committed
# with a new brig-release Version, so that clients get the new key from a
# package signed by one they trust:
# 1. --next generates a key, adds it to RPM-GPG-KEY-brig and backs it up as
#    above, without signing with it yet.
# 2. Once clients have updated brig-release, --switch with that backup makes
#    the next publish sign everything with the new key.
# 3. After that publish, --retire removes the old key.
#
# Env: BRIG_SIGNING_UID  key user ID (default: brig package signing <d.klein@gsi.de>)
#      BRIG_REPO         GitHub repository (default: dennisklein/brig)
